# CannonWar Tower Defense War

---

## Project Introduction

This is a front-end game built with pure js, called Tower Defense War. You need to upgrade buildings, protect the central base camp, and resist waves of enemy attacks.

## For visitors

**After downloading the project, double-click to open index.html and you can start playing**

## Current bugs:

After starting to play, after clicking back, start the game again, there will be a bug that the button cannot be clicked, the screen flashes, and it cannot be operated. The base camp inexplicably moves a distance to the lower right corner. **If you encounter this situation, just refresh it. **But if you refresh while the game is in progress, you will lose progress.
